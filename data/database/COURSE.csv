Global Studies;€1,202.32;Humanities Department;180;"The degree course is intended for students from all over the world interested in understanding the cultural, economic, legal, environmental, political, social, and technological phenomena that affect us regardless of our precise geographical location, the understanding of which requires a transdisciplinary approach and a comprehensive view of human beings.
The academic, scientific, and professional interest of this course lies in five key factors. Firstly, the fact that there are more and more deeply important challenges and threats of a universal scope that can only be managed and/or resolved effectively if they are considered simultaneously and synchronously by the relevant actors at the local, national, regional, and global levels. Secondly, the conviction that the dimension and depth of these challenges and threats have helped to crystallize a truly global society for the first time in human evolution. Thirdly, and in line with the previous factors, the need for transdisciplinary and interprofessional programmes focused specifically on describing, explaining, analysing, and understanding the complex phenomenon of globalization and global problems. Fourthly, the inadequacy or limitations of some of the existing study programmes that, while echoing the importance of globalization, adopt a limited interdisciplinary focus or concentrate on only one of the dimensions of this new global reality, thus limiting both its understanding and students’ training for extracting the maximum benefits from its potential and advantages and for facing the challenges and threats that come with it. Lastly, the conviction that the solution of humanity’s global problems and challenges involves studying, understanding, and reconciling, from a humanistic perspective, the mentalities, ideologies, and particular visions of the world with which they are perceived locally in the planet’s different regions.";70;Full;Ciutadella
