NAME;INFO
Department of Medicine and Life Sciences;The Faculty offers outstanding training and excellence at all university levels: undergraduate, master’s and doctorate. It currently offers three bachelor’s degree programmes, in Human Biology, Medicine, and Biomedical Engineering (together with the UPF Department of Information and Communication Technologies). It also offers five master’s degrees, in Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industry, Clinical Analysis Laboratory, Public Health, Biomedical Research and Bioinformatics for Health Sciences, the latter two in English, and a PhD programme in Biomedicine, likewise taught in English, that is highly international in terms of both students and teaching staff.
Department of Economy and Business;"The School of Economics and Business offers five degrees:(ECO) Economics (BA) Business Management and Administration (IBE) International Business Economics (taught entirely in English) (MGT) Business Sciences - Management.Double degree in Law-Economics/Business Management and Administration.The UPF Department of Economics and Business is research oriented and encourages its members to publish in the leading journals. This policy has been successful and the Department consistently appears at the top of the publication rankings in Europe."
Department of Political and Social Sciences;"The Department of Political and Social Sciences was formally founded in 1996, although an earlier group had existed since 1991. Since then, it has managed to consolidate a series of research areas and has established itself as an attractive academic institution with a strong, international profile. Today, our unit offers academic programmes and research in the fields of political science, public administration, sociology, social psychology, social determinants of health, criminology, and social science methodology. We currently have around a hundred researchers in all, including tenured, tenure-track and visiting teaching staff and pre- and postdoctoral researchers.Our unit is organized into two scientific sections: Political Sciences and Sociology - Demography. It also includes the sub-sections of Social Psychology and Social Science Methodology. The two scientific sections are organized into ten main lines of research, each associated with a different research group. All postgraduate programmes are taught in English.in fact, most of our master’s and doctoral students (around 80%) are international, primarily from Europe and Latin America, but also the United States, Canada, the Middle East and North Africa."

Faculty of Law;"he Law Academic Coordination Unit (UCA) has decades of experience in applied research in social sciences, in the formation of researchers and in postgraduate training.The Law UCA has around 150 researchers and it also has 12 research groups that aspire to provide legal practitioners with instruments to improve our institutions in favor of greater citizen welfare. The 14 fields of knowledge that have traditionally belonged to the Law Department are represented in these research groups and constitute the main lines of research of the UCA.The scientific research potential of these groups has been recognized through the funding obtained in competitive research calls and has led to an extensive scientific output. The Law UCA also has a serious commitment to Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI), which essentially focuses on the adoption of the gender perspective, the promotion of open access publications and the opening to the general society of all the activities that it organizes. Finally, the Law UCA has always encouraged the empowerment of human resources. To this end, it promotes highly innovative Master’s programmes with a marked international profile. Likewise, it manages a PhD Programme that was distinguished in 2011 with a Mention towards Excellence by the Ministry of Education and that, in the last five years, has accumulated more than 70 PhD theses."

Department of Information and Communication Technologies;" the Information and Communication Technologies Engineering (ETIC), a young and dynamic multidisciplinary department of Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF).The activities of ETIC were initiated in 1999, with the start of the undergraduate studies in Computer Science at UPF. The first members involved in these studies formed its faculty. Since then, the Department has grown with the new programs in Telematics, Audiovisual Systems, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science  and Data Science (coming soon). Several Masters and a Doctoral Program complement the current educational offer.Our community includes 45 faculty members, either permanent or in tenure track, plus many part-time professors, post-doctoral researchers and other types of (research&teaching) collaborators. It is now a well-established university center with an ideal context and infrastructure to foster top-quality research and education.The research interests of the faculty cover a broad range of topics in the field of Information and Communication Technologies. These can be grouped into four broad categories: Cognitive and Intelligent Systems.Audiovisual Technologies. Networks and Communications. Computational Biology and Biomedical Systems. and Brain and Cognition. This broad spectrum of topics reflects the current interdisciplinary reality of cutting edge research in ICT."
